A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, such as spiced potatoes,
 onions,
 peas, 
 cheese, 
 beef and other meats,
 or lentils.
 It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region. The Indian style, often accompanied by a chutney, is probably the most widely known of a broad family of recipes from Africa to China, which have origins in medieval times or earlier.Samosas are a popular entr√©e, appetizer, or snack in the local cuisines of South Asia, Western Asia, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa. Due to emigration and cultural diffusion from these areas, samosas today are often prepared in other regions.
